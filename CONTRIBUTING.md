# Contributing to Oikos

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Oikos is a small, opinionated project with deliberate architectural constraints. This guide covers what you need to know before submitting code.

## Hard Constraints

**Oikos enforces a strict "no frameworks, no build tools" policy.** This is a permanent architectural decision, not a temporary limitation.

Specifically - the following will **not** be merged:

- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)
- Bundlers or transpilers (Webpack, Vite, Rollup, esbuild, TypeScript, etc.)
- CSS libraries (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- External frontend dependencies of any kind (except Lucide Icons as self-hosted SVG sprite)

Backend dependencies are evaluated case-by-case but must remain minimal. When in doubt, open an issue before writing code.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 (required for `--experimental-sqlite` in tests)
- Git

### Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos.git
cd oikos
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Set SESSION_SECRET - leave DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY empty (no SQLCipher needed locally)
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the server with `--watch` for automatic restarts on file changes.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test              # All suites
```

Individual suites (faster during development):

```bash
npm run test:db
npm run test:tasks
npm run test:shopping
npm run test:meals
npm run test:calendar
npm run test:ncb            # notes, contacts, budget
npm run test:reminders
npm run test:dashboard
npm run test:api
npm run test:ics-parser
npm run test:ics-sub
npm run test:modal-utils
npm run test:ux-utils
npm run test:kitchen-tabs
npm run test:setup
npm run test:multi-assignment
npm run test:caldav
npm run test:carddav
npm run test:split-expenses
npm run test:backup-scheduler
npm run test:housekeeping
npm run test:mobile-scroll-layout
npm run test:frontend-audit
```

Tests use the Node.js built-in test runner with in-memory SQLite (`--experimental-sqlite`). No running server or database required — tests import route handlers directly.

## Project Structure

Understanding where things live helps you find the right place for your changes:

```
server/
  index.js             # Express entry point, middleware chain
  db.js                # SQLite connection + migration runner (append-only)
  auth.js              # Session auth + user management
  routes/              # API route handlers - one file per module
  services/            # Business logic (calendar sync, recurrence engine)
public/
  index.html           # SPA shell (single entry point)
  router.js            # Client-side History API router
  api.js               # Fetch wrapper (auth, CSRF, error handling)
  styles/
    tokens.css         # Design tokens - all colors, radii, shadows, fonts
  components/          # Reusable Web Components (oikos-* prefix)
  pages/               # Page modules - each exports a render() function
  sw.js                # Service worker
  offline.html         # Offline fallback page (served by service worker)
test/                  # One test file per module (test-[module].js)
docs/                  # Product spec, screenshots
```

**Key patterns:**

- Every API route lives in `server/routes/` and follows the same `try/catch` → JSON response pattern
- Every frontend page is an ES module in `public/pages/` that exports `render()`
- All design values come from `tokens.css` - never hardcode colors, radii, or shadows
- Database migrations are appended to the `migrations` array in `server/db.js` - never modify existing entries

## Workflow

### 1. Find or create an issue

Before starting work, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos/issues). For anything beyond a trivial fix, open an issue first to discuss the approach. This avoids wasted effort on changes that conflict with the project's direction.

### 2. Fork and branch

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oikos.git
cd oikos
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos.git
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming:**

| Prefix | Use for | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New features | `feat/csv-import-budget` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/calendar-sync-timezone` |
| `refactor/` | Internal changes (no behavior change) | `refactor/extract-date-utils` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/improve-setup-guide` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, CI, dependencies | `chore/update-helmet` |

### 3. Keep your fork in sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Rebase before opening a PR. Merge commits will be squashed.

### 4. Commit

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style` (formatting, not CSS)

**Scope:** The module or area affected - `tasks`, `shopping`, `meals`, `calendar`, `budget`, `notes`, `contacts`, `auth`, `db`, `ui`, `pwa`

**Examples:**

```
feat(meals): add drag & drop between day slots
fix(calendar): handle timezone offset in recurring events
docs(readme): add Apple CalDAV setup instructions
refactor(auth): extract session validation into middleware
test(budget): add CSV export edge cases
chore: update express to 4.21
```

**Rules:**

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters
- Body (optional): explain *why*, not *what* - the diff shows the what
- One logical change per commit - don't mix features with formatting

### 5. Open a pull request

- Target branch: `main`
- Title: follows the same Conventional Commits format as your commits
- Description: explain what the PR does, why, and link the related issue (`Closes #123`)
- Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR

**Before opening:**

```bash
npm test              # All tests pass
```

### 6. Review and merge

PRs are reviewed by the maintainer. Expect feedback within a few days. Once approved, PRs are squash-merged into `main`.

## Code Conventions

### General

- ES modules everywhere (`import`/`export`, never `require`)
- Semicolons: **yes**
- `try/catch` in every route handler - no unhandled promise rejections
- No dynamic code execution. Never write user data directly into an HTML string — use `esc()` from `public/utils/html.js` in template literals, or DOM API (`createElement`, `textContent`). Use `insertAdjacentHTML` to append HTML fragments, `replaceChildren()` to replace content. Direct `innerHTML` writes are blocked by a pre-commit hook.

### Frontend

- Web Component prefix: `oikos-` (one component per file)
- All UI text via i18n keys (`t('key')`) - never hardcode text in components. German (`de`) is the reference locale.
- Date format: `DD.MM.YYYY` - Time format: `HH:MM` (24h)
- CSS uses design tokens from `public/styles/tokens.css` - never hardcode values
- Pages export a `render()` function, no side effects on import

### Backend

- One route file per module in `server/routes/`
- API responses: `{ data: ... }` on success, `{ error: string, code: number }` on failure
- Database migrations: append to the `migrations` array in `server/db.js` - **never modify existing entries**
- Every table: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, `created_at TEXT`, `updated_at TEXT` (ISO 8601)

### Testing

- One test file per module in the `test/` directory (`test/test-[module].js`)
- Tests use in-memory SQLite via `--experimental-sqlite`
- Import route handlers directly - no HTTP calls, no running server

## Changelog

User-facing changes should be reflected in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). If your PR adds a feature, fixes a bug, or changes behavior, add an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate category (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`).

Format: imperative mood, one line per change, user-oriented language.

```markdown
### Added
- Add CSV import for budget entries
```

## Reporting Issues

### Bugs

[Open an issue](https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos/issues/new) with:

- What you expected vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment (browser, OS, Docker version if relevant)
- Screenshots if applicable

### Feature requests

Describe the **use case** before proposing a solution. There might be a simpler approach that fits the existing architecture.

Features that conflict with the project's [hard constraints](#hard-constraints) or significantly expand scope will likely be declined. When in doubt, ask first.

### Security vulnerabilities

Do **not** open a public issue. Use [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos/security/advisories/new) instead. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for details.
