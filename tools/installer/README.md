# Oikos Web Installer

A browser-based setup wizard for Oikos. Run it once to configure your `.env`,
start your container engine, and create your admin account — no hand-editing of
config files. Works with both Docker and Podman (auto-detected).

## Usage

From the repository root:

```bash
node tools/installer/install-server.js
```

Then open **http://localhost:8090** in your browser.

The server shuts down automatically after setup completes (or after 30 minutes of inactivity).

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (the installer itself has zero npm dependencies — Node built-ins only)
- A container engine — either **Docker** with Compose v2, or **Podman** with the
  `podman compose` subcommand (4.1+) or the `podman-compose` package
- The repository cloned locally

The wizard auto-detects the engine (Docker preferred, Podman fallback) and verifies
that it plus its compose command are available before it starts, surfacing container
start/spawn errors in the UI instead of failing silently. With Podman it uses the
dedicated `podman-compose.yml` (SELinux `:Z` labels).

## What it does

1. Detects the container engine (Docker or Podman), checks its prerequisites, and
   reports any existing `.env` file or running `oikos` container before you start
2. Guides you through all configuration options, grouped into steps:
   - **Basics** — timezone (`TZ`) and HTTP host port (`OIKOS_HTTP_PORT`)
   - **Security keys** — generates `SESSION_SECRET` and `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - **Optional integrations** — weather, Google Calendar, Apple CalDAV
   - **Advanced** — reverse-proxy/HTTPS (`SESSION_SECURE`, `TRUST_PROXY`),
     Single Sign-On (OIDC), and automatic backups
3. Backs up any existing `.env` to `.env.bak-<ISO>` before writing
4. Writes `.env` to the project root (keys are allowlisted against the shared
   env schema; values containing line breaks are rejected)
5. Starts the container (`docker compose up -d`, or `podman compose -f
   podman-compose.yml up -d` / `podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml up -d`)
6. Polls the health endpoint until the container is ready
7. Creates your first admin account via `POST /api/v1/auth/setup`

## Localization

The wizard is fully localized into all 16 languages supported by the app and
detects the browser language automatically (`de` is the reference locale, `en`
the fallback). Translations live in `tools/installer/locales/*.json` and are
loaded by `i18n-mini.js`, which mirrors the app's locale resolution.

The **CLI installer** (`install.sh` at the repo root) is localized into the same
16 languages. It detects the language from the shell environment
(`OIKOS_INSTALLER_LANG` > `LC_ALL` > `LC_MESSAGES` > `LANG`) and accepts a
`--lang <code>` override. Its strings live in `tools/installer/locales/cli/<lang>.sh`
— one sourced shell file per language that sets `MSG_*` variables; `en.sh` is the
fallback base, the active language overlays it. Key parity across all 16 files is
enforced by `test-installer-cli-i18n.js`.

## Design

The wizard reuses the app's design language: shared design tokens
(`public/styles/tokens.css`) and the Plus Jakarta Sans variable font are served
read-only from the repo, so the installer matches the app's violet accent,
radii, shadows, and automatic dark mode. The wizard meets WCAG 2.1 AA
(keyboard-operable accordions, ARIA live regions for Docker status, focus
management, and labelled controls).

## Architecture

- `install-server.js` — the temporary HTTP server (port 8090). Endpoints:
  `GET /api/defaults` (serves `ENV_SCHEMA`), `GET /api/prereqs`,
  `GET /api/preflight` (existing `.env` / running container),
  `POST /api/generate-secret`, `POST /api/save-env`, `POST /api/start`,
  `GET /api/status`, `POST /api/create-admin`.
- `env-schema.js` — the single source of truth (`ENV_SCHEMA`) for every
  configurable variable, its group, default, and whether it is written to `.env`.
- `i18n-mini.js` + `locales/*.json` — web-wizard localization.
- `locales/cli/*.sh` — CLI-installer localization (sourced by `install.sh`).
- `install.html` — the wizard UI.
